How to represent the complexity of an Algorithm
------------------------------------------------

By using Asymptotic notations - mathematical tools used to represent time and space complexity

1. Big-O Notation(O-Notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation  - Average case complexity
