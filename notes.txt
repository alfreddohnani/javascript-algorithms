How to represent the complexity of an Algorithm
------------------------------------------------

We cannot calculate the absolute running time of an algorithm, hence,

By using Asymptotic notations - mathematical tools used to represent time and space complexity

1. Big-O Notation(O-Notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation  - Average case complexity


Big-O Notation
- Expressed in terms of input
- Focuses on the big picture

Big-O Time complexity
- we count the number of times a statement executes based on the input size
